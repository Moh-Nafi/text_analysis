# Predicting Sentiment of the Customer Reviews

### Data description
This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. 
This dataset includes around 10,000 rows. Each row corresponds to a customer review. Based on the text review of the customer, our goal is to develop 
a predictive model that can classify whether the customer recommends the product (where 1 is recommended, 0 is not recommended).

### Project Protocol
Step 1: Import data and build a corpus for text mining

Step 2: Clean and pre-process the text data

Step 3: Generate the TF-IDF matrix of the documents

Step 4: Reduce term dimensions by removing less frequent terms

Step 5: Predictive modeling – Classification

Step 6: Generate the word cloud (Just for Fun!!)
